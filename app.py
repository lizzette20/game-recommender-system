"""
This script launches a Gradio web application that recommends video games based on the user's mood and preferred genre. 

It connects to a local SQLite database ('games.db') to retrieve relevant games and uses a local Ollama language model to generate a short AI-powered game review for each suggestion.

Features:
- Takes user input for mood and optional game genre
- Recommends up to two matching games from the database
- Uses Ollama via HTTP API to generate concise, mood-aligned reviews
- Displays results through an interactive Gradio interface

Usage:
    1. Ensure 'games.db' exists and contains game data including mood and genre.
    2. Start Ollama locally with the correct model (e.g., `tinyllama`).
    3. Run this script: python app.py
    4. A public Gradio link will be generated to access the interface.
